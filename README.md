Welcome to the **Multi energy management and aggregation platform (MEMAP)** project!

The platform aims to enable a potential energy exchange and increase the efficiency with sector coupling, by interconnecting several quarters on the local level. The platform creates an optimized schedule, so that connected buildings save costs, if more efficient components for energy production are available. It is also possible to optimize the energy operations to reduce CO2 emissions.

A local EMS communicates with the MEMAP system using the OPC Unified Architecture protocols (OPC UA).
