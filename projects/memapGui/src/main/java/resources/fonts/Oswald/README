Google Fonts ZIP
=================================

This directory contains Oswald as both a variable font and static fonts.

Oswald is a variable font that has the following axes: wght. This means
all the info is contained in a single file, Oswald-VariableFont:wght.ttf.
Not all apps support variable fonts, in those cases, you can use the static font
files for Oswald:

  Oswald-ExtraLight.ttf -- 200 weight
  Oswald-Light.ttf -- 300 weight
  Oswald-Regular.ttf -- 400 weight
  Oswald-Medium.ttf -- 500 weight
  Oswald-SemiBold.ttf -- 600 weight
  Oswald-Bold.ttf -- 700 weight

Get started
---------------------------------

Step 1 - Install the font files you want to use

Step 2 - Use your app's font picker to view the font family and all the
available styles

If your app fully supports variable fonts, you can now pick intermediate styles
that weren’t available before. If your app doesn’t support variable fonts, then
you can use the static font files.
